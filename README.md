# Community API Repository
The _**WebWorks-Community-APIs**_ repository is an area where members of the community can post up their JavaScript Extensions to share with the rest of the world.  

This area is a collection of APIs that are not part of the official BlackBerry WebWorks SDK but may prove as a testing ground for new APIs before they are officially added to the WebWorks SDK

All APIs shared in this repository are Open Source under the  [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)

To contribute code to this repository, make sure you have signed up as an [official contributor](https://github.com/blackberry/WebWorks/wiki/How-to-Contribute).

## Code Organization
The APIs in this repository are broken out into APIs for the BlackBerry Smartphone OS and APIs for the BlackBerry Tablet OS.  When adding your API to this repository you'll need to create your own sub-directory in the appropriate platform directory.

For specific information on how to organize your code in each of these sections, please refer to the README found in both the Smartphone and Tablet directories.  They will have specific information on what pieces are needed to contribute an extension for each of the platforms.
